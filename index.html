	  	<h2>The Early Years</h2>
	   	 <hr>
		    <p>I was born in Elk Grove Village, IL. I, then, grew up in the Chicagoland area until leaving for college in 2006.  In between I played soccer and volleyball through high school and started to appreciate history and film.</p>
		  <h2>Education</h2>
		   <hr>
		    <p>I enrolled at the University of Illinois in fall 2006 and spent two years there remaining undecided in my major.  In 2008 I transferred to DePaul University in Chicago where I declared a major in History and a minor in Digital Cinema (film production).</p>
		    <p>During the summers I worked at a children's STEM education camp where I used LEGO bricks to teach science, technology, engineering, and math.  After four years I had become fairly proficient in building sculptures from these little bricks.  And so with that in mind, I graduated and set my sights on starting a career.</p>
		  <h2>The Real World</h2>
		   <hr>
		    <p>While job hunting at home one day, I found an ad in the local newspaper seeking a new LEGO Master Model Builder.  At first, I was hesitant to apply fearing that I would embarrass myself with my building ability, or lack thereof.  At my father's insistence I applied and was chosen as one of eight finalists who would complete in a live build off to determine the next Master Model Builder.</p>
		    <p>I ended up winning the job and after 2 1/2 years of playing with toys for a living, I decided to switch to the Madame Tussauds branch as an Operations Manager - a purely managerial role.  After a year I realized I no longer found pleasure in a position so void of creativity.  That brings us to the present where I now find myself trying to mix my love of creativity/art and modern technology.  I have always built with my hands and now look forward to building my name on the internet.</p>
